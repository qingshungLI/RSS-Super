RSS for the andriod system is easy to read, making push dislike a thing of the past
## Intention for creating a rss reader
When I browse the social media like TikTok„ÄÅX or facebook,the things that is boring and have litter relation with my major and hobbyies will distract me.I can't pay attention to the field that I really care.As the recommending algorithm progressing,the non-relation things even look like more interesting than our preference.

When I start thinking how can solve this problem,I discover a article introducing RSS.This is a good idea!But there are so many existing softwares for rss-reading,why do I create one again?The reason for that:first I can practice my programming ability.When I change the perspective of working:from a user to a developer,I just realized developing a software is a many complex and difficult thing no matter whether the software is simple or complex.Second this is a long-term thing,managng my information input is a crucial thing throughout my lifetime.Information shapes a people.
